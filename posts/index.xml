self-critical: Our ancestors acted wrongly because they failed to be sufficiently self-critical.
I can make parallel mistakes in ethical delibrations:
I might use inconsistent ethical principles. I might have inappropriate moral standards. I might employ moral standards inappropriately. Let us look at each deliberate error in more detail
Consistency: Correct Principles: Moral judgements based on misinformation, shortsightedness, bias , or lack of understanding are flawed.</description></item><item><title>Simple Neural Network in Pytorch</title><link>https://sudo-umar.github.io/posts/my-first-post/</link><pubDate>Tue, 07 Jun 2022 15:26:15 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://sudo-umar.github.io/posts/my-first-post/</guid><description>The only pre-requeste to understanding this simple article is just the basic understanding of python.
We are going to create a simple regressor - a model which is used for predicting the continuous variable - in pytorch.
Dataset First, create a dataset containing our observations(examples) and the labels associated with each observation.
import torch import numpy # column 1 mu1,sig1 = 0,0.1 x1 = np.random.normal(mu1,sig1,(100)) x1 = x1.reshape(100,1) # column 2 mu2,sig2 = 1,1.</description></item></channel></rss>
