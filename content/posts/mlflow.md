## MLFlow:
It is a platform that offers different services to manage the ML lifecycle, including experimentation, reproducibility and deployment. It currently offers four main components:
### 1. MLflow tracking:

Record and query experiments. For example, we can store evaluation metric, number of features, the whole notebook against each run of our model. So, we can keep track of stuff happening when we change a certain thing during training.

### 2. MLflow Projects:
Package the whole code to reproduce on any platform.

### 3. MLflow Models:
Deploy models in diverse environments.

### 4. Model Registry:
Store, annotate, and manage models in a central repository.

Hands on tutorial is inside the below mentioned notebook.
