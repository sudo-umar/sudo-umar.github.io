## Theorizing about Ethics

In choosing how to behave one should acknowledge that his actions may affect others, even if only indirectly.

**self-critical**: Our ancestors acted wrongly because they failed to be sufficiently self-critical.

I can make  parallel mistakes in ethical delibrations:

1. I might use inconsistent ethical principles.
2. I might have inappropriate moral standards.
3. I might employ moral standards inappropriately.

Let us look at each deliberate error in more detail

1. **Consistency**:
2. **Correct Principles**:

Moral judgements based on misinformation, shortsightedness, bias , or lack of understanding are flawed. 

### The Role of Theory:

You can challenge someone's evualtion in three ways: challege his criteria, the weights given to them, and whether that criteria can be apllied to htat situation.

### Main types of theory:

Two broad classes of ethical theory- consequentialist and deontologist. Consequentialists hold thatwe should choose our actions with the best overall consequences. Deontologists hold that we should act in ways circumscribed by moral rules or rights. These rules or rights are defined( at least partly) independently of consequences.

#### Consequentialism : 

Consequentialists claim that we are morally obliged to act in ways that produce the ==best consequences==, e.g. if you are trying to decide whether to keep the present job or not you will look at the outcomes of each scenario-salary, job growth etc. It requires us to consider the interests of all affected.

All consequences are not morally relevant. So, any consequentialist theory must specifiy  which are ==morally releveant== and ==what weight== we should assign to them.

**Utilitarians** claim we should choose the option that maximizes greatest happiness of the greatest number. They also ask for complete equality. Each individual is count as one no more than that or less.

- Actions should be measured in terms of Happiness or Pleasure they produce.
- You should not be emotionally invested when making a decision .

#### Deontology:

It claims that our moral obligations are in some ways independent of consequences.
For example, most of us would be offended if someone lied to us, even if the lie produced the greatest happiness for the greatest number. I would certainly be offended if someone kill me, even if my death might brbing happiness for the greatest number(you use mykidney to save two people's lives, my heart etc). The ==rightness of killing and lying== cannot be wholly explained on the basis of its consequences.

##### Applying deontological reasoning

1. State a maxim and why and how to intend it.

2. Imagine a world with that maxim as an universal law.

3. Can the goal be achieved in this world?

##### Problems

- Needs to be seen from different perspectives, since own perspective might be biased


- If moral duties conflict with each other, there is no clear path.

- No gray areas are possible, since the line is really strict.
â†’ an act either is universalizable or it is not

#### Alternatives

##### Virtue theory

**Ethical Theory** that **Emphasizes** an **individual's character** rather than following a set of rules.

It says that you should become virtuous becuse, if you are, then you can attain the pinnacle of humanity.  It allows you to achieve what is known as **Eudomonia**.  A Eudomonistic life is full of happiness that comes from achieving something really difficult, rathan than having it handed it over to you.
 This is according to Aristotle what morality is. It is being the best you can personally be, honning your strengths while working on your weaknesses. It is for Aristotle a kind of person who lives like this, is the kind of person who will do good things.

If you become a good person the right actions will follow.
Virtue theorists claim deontology and consequentialism put inadequate emphasis on the agent- on the ways ways she should be or the character she develop. 

These formal theories tend to resemble hard and fast rules not factor of judgement involves in them. e.g the rule says'be honest' the rule says 'always acto to promote the greatest happiness of the greatest number' then we need to figure out which actions brings the most desirable consequences.
Virtues are values for judging the moral goodness of a person such as

- wisdom
- justice
- courage
- liberty
- truthfulness
- patience

#### Feminist Ethics

aims to underestand,criticize and correct how gender operates within our moral belief system. More specifically it aims to understand, criticize and correct: 1.the binary view of gender 2 the privilege historically available to men and 3 the ways that views about gendere maintain oppressive social orders.

### Reading Philosophy

#### The Centrality of Argument:

Arguement = Series of statements + central claim + evidence supporting/ defending the conclusion
