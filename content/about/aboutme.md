I'm a passion merchant in the field of data science and sometimes also get motivated by the data engineering stuff. Working as data scientist/for a period of time as data engineer since 2017. 

Passionate about football and big supporter of Real Madrid FC. Also sometimes like to read quality books. Favourite book of all time = 1984 by George Orwell
